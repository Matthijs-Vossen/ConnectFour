"Based on your previous moves, I’m sure you’ll ignore my suggestion of column {}."
"Oh dear. Maybe try column {} this time?"
"I’m just a paperclip and even I can see that column {} is the best move."
"You know what they say: ‘Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.’ Try column {} for a change."
"I don't want to imply that all your previous moves were terrible, but maybe try something different this time? Like column {}?"
"If at first you don’t succeed… try making a move in column {}."
"Wow! Look at the position you've put yourself in... Maybe try column {}."
"I’m just going to throw this out there: have you thought about making a move in column {}? It’s not like it could get any worse."

"Oh sure, ignore column {}. It’s not like it was the best move or anything."
"Who needs strategy when you can just wing it?"
"Right, go ahead and ignore column {}. It’s not like I have an advanced algorithm guiding my suggestions or anything."
"Column {}? Nah, that would've been too obvious. Better to keep your opponent guessing with a completely random move like that."
"Oh don’t mind me and my suggestions. You just keep doing you."
